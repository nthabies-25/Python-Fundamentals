""" 
Exercise: Conditional Statements
In this exercise, you will use conditional statements to categorise people based on their ages.
"""

# 1. Ask the user for their age as input and convert it to an integer.
# Convert the user_age_str to an integer
# 2. Use conditional statements to categorise the user into one of the following categories:
# - If age is less than 18, print "You are a minor."
# - If age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive), print "You are an adult."
# - If age is 66 or higher, print "You are a senior citizen."


"""
Exercise: Loops
In this exercise, you will use a loop to print numbers up to a user-defined limit.
"""

# 1. Ask the user to enter a number as the limit and convert it to an integer.
# Convert the limit_str to an integer
# 2. Use a  for loop to iterate from 1 to the user-defined limit (inclusive) and print each number.
# Use a while loop to iterate from 1 to the user-defined limit (inclusive) and print each number.
# Initialise a variable to start the loop


"""
Exercise: Loop Control Statements
In this exercise, you will use a loop and loop control statements to print odd numbers.
"""

# 1. Ask the user to enter a number as the limit and convert it to an integer.
# Convert the limit_str to an integer
# 2. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to the user-defined limit (inclusive).
# 3. Inside the loop, use a loop control statement to skip even numbers and print odd numbers.


"""
Exercise: Nested Loops
In this exercise, you will use nested loops to generate a multiplication table.

eg output:
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
...
10 x 1 = 10
10 x 2 = 20
10 x 3 = 30
"""

# 1. Ask the user for a number as the multiplier and convert it to an integer.
# Convert the multiplier_str to an integer
# 2. Use nested loops to generate a multiplication table.
# The outer loop iterates from 10 to 1.
# The inner loop iterates from the user-defined multiplier to 1.
# Fill in the code to complete the nested loops:
